## History

The idea of #notGDC came from lots of people, including [Squid In
A Box](https://twitter.com/squidinabox/status/176983168027598848) way back in 2012 and [Ben
Porter](https://eigenbom.github.io/notgdc2017/) in 2017.

The first event was organized by Ben Proter in 2017. Since then it has been run
entirely by volunteers. People from around the world are free to submit anything
related to game development, in the spirit of free knowledge-sharing.

As costs to attend game development conferences continue to increase, and
layoffs are a grim reality within the industry, we hope that notGDC will
give an alternative venue for people to share

Huge thanks to everyone who has given their time to help bring it to life,
whether that's by submitting talks, attending or organizing.
