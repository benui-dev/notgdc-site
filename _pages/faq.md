### What is #notGDC?

#notGDC is a casual and loosely structured game development non-conference that takes place at the same time as GDC. #notGDC is 100% online and free to participate in. #notGDC was started for people who make games to share ideas, skills and things they love with the international games community.


### Where does #notGDC take place?

#notGDC is happening all online, March 20-24th 2023. Submissions we receive will be uploaded manually to [notgdc.io]({% link index.html %}#submissions) during that time. 


### Is #notGDC affiliated with GDC?

Despite our name, we are not affiliated with GDC. #notGDC was started to make game dev knowledge free and accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are. Conferences cost time, money, and mobility, and we want to remove that barrier. 


### How much does #notGDC cost to attend?

Nothin‚Äô! It‚Äôs free!


### What happens at #notGDC?

The goal of #notGDC is to showcase knowledge and perspectives from people of all backgrounds who love making games. Throughout the week we will manually upload submissions we receive to the #notGDC archive that can be accessed by anyone, anywhere, anytime! 

#notGDC comes to life through submissions from game devs like you, so if you have something you want to share, an idea you‚Äôve been sitting on, or a lesson you wish you knew early on in your game-making journey, we encourage you to submit to our archive this year!
