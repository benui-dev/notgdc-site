Way back in 2012 _squid in a box_ posted on Twitter:

> Maybe we should have our own #NotGDC right here on Twitter. If you are at #GDC you aren't invited. This is not for you.

Later in 2017 Ben Porter hosted the very first notGDC, [notgdc2017](https://eigenbom.github.io/notgdc2017/). The links to the submissions are mirrored here.
