# notgdc-site

notGDC is a development non-conference, for everyone!

The site runs using Jekyll, and is open-source, in the hope that the project
continues to be maintained by the community. For ever.âœ¨

## Tasks

Look, we're task managing!

### Site Visuals

* [ ] New skin system
* [ ] Add Bluesky icon
* [ ] Make icons 2-3x larger under "how to take part"

### Data

* [ ] Mark dead links with some meta info in yaml
	* [ ] Update bot to skip dead links
* [ ] Write script to download images for each page (?)

### Performance

* [ ] Remove Bootstrap if possible
* [ ] Remove unused font, both in css and assets
* [ ] Remove any js dependencies if possible
* [ ] Get rid of fonts like Comfortaa if we don't use them
* [ ] Do we need all the "stylish portfolio" stuff?
* [ ] On main page we're loading Lexend in 700, regular, 500 and 300. Do we need all of those?
