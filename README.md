# notgdc-site

notGDC is a development non-conference, for everyone!

The site runs using Jekyll, and is open-source, in the hope that the project
continues to be maintained by the community. For everâœ¨

## TODO

Look, we're task managing!

### Site Visuals

  * [ ] Update favicon

  * [ ] Show border or background change on hover
  * [ ] Don't show blue underscore on hover
* [ ] Consolidate URLs with archive
  * [ ] Remove separate URLs for 2022, 2021 etc.
  * [ ] Instead there should be a single point of interaction: /archive/?year=blah
  * [ ] Simple urls like /2022/ should forward to archive
* [ ] Work out what is causing the unknown checkbox that is last in the list on
  the archive page
* [x] Make it so checkbox filters show a pointer cursor
  * [x] Make checkbox filters clickable area match visual bg
* [x] Fix horizontal scroll bar appearing
* [x] Add juice to Button on-hover (see terranil.com for example)

  * [x] Only show minutes if days == 0
  * [x] Only show hours if days < 3 && hours > 0
  * [x] Only show days if days > 0
* [x] Update CSS so it's not a nightmare to get center-aligned buttons (see all the empty divs being used to force center-alignment
* [x] Change theme to use locally-hosted fonts instead of Google
  * [x] Download font convert to woff
  * [x] Update CSS
* [x] Clean up some of the layout stuff from 2020 (see default.md)

  * [x] It's kind of gross adding center-aligned buttons stuff
  * [x] Center-aligning buttons
    * NOTE: Cleaned up the layout stuff, instead of using the bootstrap columns we just put them all in the same column, effectively "flexbox-wrap"'ing them.
    * Added some margins so they wrap correctly and don't stuck together
* [x] Do pass on page speed optimization https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnotgdc.io%2F
